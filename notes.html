    - "Happy Tuesday!" I glanced at the message and then put the phone away. Not sure how to even respond to that one, plus I'm too busy. She sent another one that said, "Nothing?? You're avoiding me now?? I thought we were friends!". "Sorry I'm just running late and need to get ready"
    - Write message in card.
<b>Page 4:</b> 
    - DONE. But could include extra:
    - Stuff about her following you closely. e.g he followed me downstairs, then followed me to the kitchen, then followed me to the cupboard while I got a cereal bowl, then followed me to the spoon drawer, then followed me to the cereal cupboard, then followed me to the fridge, then followed me to the kitchen table.

    - Passage about guy hitting on you and Madison sabotaging it - brought up a really personal story about me to disgust him and turn his attention to her. "She did a number on me, made me feel inadequate, awkward, unattractive”. 
    When I confided in her that I was asexual, she told me she'd keep my secret. Then ten minutes later she's telling all her other friends in a big group MSN chat that I wasn't part of whilst I'm on the toilet in the other room. 
    I came back in to her hastily minimising and logging out, a friend we both knew sent me screenshots later that night of the group chat and her saying things like "She says she's asexual lol that just means virgin" and "We should pay the boys to rape her lol she won't be very asexual then". I still have the screenshots somewhere.

    - This section isn't really written, needs a lot of work.
    - The copying creates a kind of weird situation.  
    - Madison correcting my grammar and always having done one better
<b>Page 7:</b>
    - Write conversation with Maddy in canteen. Where she's dominating the conversation, on subject/s you're not interested in, and whenever you do contribute, she’s repeating phrases you say, quickly backtracking and changing her opinions to match yours, and copying your mannerisms. 
        She started copying me. Everything about me. It was something straight out of “Single White Female”. She started using my frequent phrases, tried to pick up all my hobbies, and started dressing *exactly* like me. 
        The final straw was when she started getting really possessive when I would hang out with people without her and tried to turn me against all my other friends. We aren’t friends anymore, but everyone tells me she’s still obsessed with me and talks about how I abandoned her to anyone who will listen.
        She pretended that her family was rich, boasting about her parents summer villa, what new gadget her parents had bought her, she had "5 pairs of airpod, 3 apple watches, two ipads." she just kept them at home. 
        She was a pathological, compulsive liar who was manipulating and told unbelievable and outrageous lies and expected everyone to believe them. She also was a know-it-all, and used fake facts to make it seem like she was right.
        If I had a problem, she would always have to have a worse problem than me. For example, when my parents were going through a very messy divorce and I didn't know where I was going to live, she started with all the "my parents hit me" crap and always had to be one up.
        I was only friends with her because I was the new kid and no one else was nice to me. But I have actual friends now, who get me, and aren't superficial or manipulative. Why are we still friends.
    - Assignment conversation, change it to " that's not due till we get back from summer break." Maybe?
    - She see's you looking over to the other table and blurts out ”you know, I’m only telling you this because your my best friend, but the other day, I was looking at L’s phone and I saw that she had been googling how to get rid of a smelly vaginal discharge! oh my gosh! Isn’t that disgusting?! Can you imagine?!”
    - You tell her that she's being oobnoxious, gossiping about highly personal info. But you know already, Lucy had confided to you in tears just the other day. You decide to abandon Madison, you've had enough.
    - There needs to be some padding when you get to the other table of friends. 
        E.g Madison constantly texting you once you leave her table.
        "(Meme)", "OMG, look at this (link)", "urgh, I need to pee", "What are you guys talking about?", "oh I hope you're having fun with your new friends", "Bet you wish you had hair like Emma's", "Maybe you should look into getting Keratine treatment. It'll do wonders for your kinks" (because you're ignoring her) 
        "Actually, Emma's hair isn't that special, I bet she just uses leave in conditioner." "And imagine not wearing makeup, some people just can't get away without hiding their ugliness" "Chloe has really crooked teeth, don't you think?" "Harper walks like a lesbian" "And Lucy probably has lice because she keeps scratching her head". 
        "Cassandra is such an oreo. The way she dresses, definitely white on the inside." "Being gay is definitely immoral... Chloe is going to hell, unless maybe she atleast trys to be straight" 
        You continually ignoring her will make her get up and storm your table. She’d get jealous if I either didn’t answer super quick, said ‘nothing’, or if I was with other friends. But I felt dread every time their message icon popped up.
    - Flesh out Madison spewing gossip about them. All the mean things she was just texting about.  
<b>Page 8:</b>
    - Needs cleaning up.

    "When you got sick of me and threw me away like an old toy, replacing me almost instantly."
    "When I would listen to all the things happening in their life excited for them and asking questions about things they felt excited about, yet when it came time for me to talk about things I felt excited about going on in my life they would brush it off and keep talking about themselves."
    "When you made plans in front of me and didn’t invite me."
    "You made me feel inadequate and depressed."
    "That universal fear that we are just not good enough. And the same fear is part of why it is so painful to be ghosted."
    "Why cut someone off without saying why?"
    "Because explaining opens a conversation, implying I want to work things out, but I don’t."
    "You're just a coward, you never wabt to say anything negative outright, because you don't want to ruin this notion that you're a good person."
    "...."
    "You swallow our hurt—until it chokes you."
    "..."
    "You've been 'stamp collecting' whenever I said or did something you didn’t like, you say nothing, but then you put a stamp in your book. When the page is filled with stamps, you slam it shut and throw the book at them."

    - Scene where you're desperately trying to remove bracelet. Ripping, cutting with scissors, etc, nothing is working. In desperation (you're in DT class) you cut our hand off at the wrist.

    - Madison dressed identically to you.

    - Madison getting mad that you don't want to meet up with her after school.
    - Or Madison ruining your relationship with the other friends, by spreading gossip. 
<b>Page 8:</b>  
    If I have the time and want to make the story and artwork more complicated I could:
    - Chasing Madison/ her exiting canteen.
    - Confronting Madison about her bahaviour and wanting space/to end friendship.
    - Madison's confession.
    - Thought bubbles, remembering all the times Madison must have been controlling you.
<b>Page 9: </b>
    - Try ripping bracelet off.
    - Try cutting it off.
    - In desperation you cut your hand off.
