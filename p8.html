                    That’s it. You’ve had enough. You jolt out of your seat and make a dash after Madison. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Madison’s behaviour has been getting clingier and clingier, she’s been possessive about you hanging out with others during class, at lunch, and now she’s even roadblocking any attempts you try to make plans for after school. She wants to do absolutely EVERYTHING together. And she doesn't want you to have anyone else but her.
                    <br><br> 
                    Your resentment has been building up for some time, but this just consolidates it, you’re going to end the friendship today.
                    <br><br> 
                    blurt out a confession of what’s going on, why they’ve resorted to this. I’m sorry that you made me do this, but you were pulling away and I can’t have that. I need you, you need me. We’re perfect together. They are both wearing bracelets.
                    Conflict with Madison. Confronting her. She reveals that she has full control over you. You frantically try to rip the bracelet off. She lets you head off to your next class. I’m just trying to help you see. You’re perfect for me and I’m perfect for you. We were meant to be 
                    <br><br> 
                    You realise that the reason the friend has been so bad today – well, she’s generally awful, but today she has been the absolute worst – is because she’s testing the parameters of the bracelet. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Whenever the you’ve tried to confront her, or combat the behaviour you were unable to do so. It was her.
