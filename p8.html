                    By the end of the day, you realise she will do whatever it takes to be in your life forever.
                    <br><br> 
                    The more that you pull away from the friendship, the more that the friend uses the bracelet to reign you back in.
                    <br><br> 
                    Is this it.
                    <br><br> 
                    I’ll never be free of her.
                    <br><br> 
                    In desperation you force your hand in the way You decide to cut your arm off. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Add bits into the story where madison is interacting with her bracelet, when you freeze, and weird things happen.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>
                    Notes: Add bits where you’re constantly receiving texts from madison, when she’s not with you. Like at the other table in canteen.
