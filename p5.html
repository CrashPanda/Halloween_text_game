                <p>During class Madison insists on sitting next to you, she edges her desk a couple of inches closer to yours. The attention doesn’t bother you too much. She’s been staring and chattering away at you constantly, but you’ve barely present in class anyway, and have been staring at the same discoloured patch on the celling for the past 20 minutes, zoning in and out of class. Madison kept you up late last night, insisting on discussing ____ and sharing tik tok memes of ____.  Suddenly you hear a sharp screech, rumble and thud. The tutor said something or other about working in pairs for the next assignment, and Madison has extatically rushed to butt your tables together before anyone else. 
                    <br><br> 
                    She pulls out her pencil case, it’s identical to yours, even down to its contents. The exact same brand and model of  ruler, eraser, pens and pencils…. The only difference is that she’s picked them in her favourite colour, green, whereas mine are in, purple. You are about to tease her, about there being a stationary store down the road that sells some of the largest variety of stationary out there (think of something meaner), but something stops the words rolling off your tongue. Ha! That was strange. Maybe it was my conscience? I guess that would have be too harsh to say out loud. Well, at least it’s some consolation that she has some sense of autonomy, not choosing the same colours. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Shortly after being paired, the bell rings, signalling our lunch break. Madison starts to ask if I would like to join her for lunch, but the tutor interrupts her by calling out my name and asking me to stay behind after class. Madison keeps interrupting, but I can’t focus on the two of them at the same time, so I focus on the tutor explaining why I must stay behind. As I get up and head to the tutor at his desk, Madison sharply exclaims “stop”, and just like that I do. I don’t know what it was about that tone, but it froze me in my tracks. She was insisting that I give her an answer. “Lunch. Together. Yes?” I mumble “huh, OK, maybe”. Feeling drained, I turn, pause, and take a breath. My vague non-committal reply was enough to release me from her demanding attention.
