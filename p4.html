                <p>When you get to school, before you’ve even stepped out of your parent’s car, Madison is there knocking on the car window to greet you. 
                <br><br>     
                    Madison: “So did you like the gift?”, she blasts at the window. “Look, we’re matching”, she says as she presses her wrist against the glass. 
                <br><br>    
                    You: “Yeah, thanks, it was sweet.” You say preoccupied, as you step out of the car whilst adjusting your uniform and srambling together your things. 
                <br><br>       
                    You turn to around, and madisons wide eyed, doting face is no more than a foot away from yours. 
                <br><br>            
                    Madison: “I’m so glad”, she says pressingly.
                <br><br>             
                    You awkwardly try to move around her to head to the school entrance, when you notice that she’s dressed pretty much identically to you that morning. As you walk Madison is following you close, like a lost puppy.
