                <p>Include something here about a guy showing interest in you and Madison interjecting and flirting with him whilst putting you down. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Already walking away, I say “Hey look, I’m going to head over and say hello to those guys and put my things in my locker, I’ll see you in class, ok?”.
                    <br><br> 
                    Madison’s brow crinkles slightly and she seems to momentarily sink in mood, but her demenor shifts just as fast into a manically bubbly, “Sure. Absolutely. No problem. See you in there!”
                    <br><br> 
                    Something felt jarring (Suddenly, I felt unnerved), and I was compelled to stop and turn. There Madison was staring at me teeth baring in the widest grin, she waves, then sets off in the other direction. 
                    <br><br> 
                    That was strange I think to myself, but brush it off (do my best to shake off that interaction) before speaking to my friend’s next to my locker.
