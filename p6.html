                    I turn around, after paying for my lunch, and I’ve barely had a chance to scan the room and there she is. Standing tall, dramatically waving her arms above her head, very vocally signalling for you to come and sit next to her in the canteen.  
                    <br><br> 
                    You glace at your other group of friends two tables away, then glance back at her and sigh. It would be rude to ignore her obvious invite. Feeling obligated, you head over to her. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Whilst you’re eating with her, you reluctantly talk about subject that you have the vaguest interest in. She’s guiding the conversation, but whenever you do contribute, you notice that she’s repeating phrases you say and copying your mannerisms.
                    <br><br> 
                    You finish your last chip, and you say “Hey, look, I’m going to go sit with those guys for a bit before our next class. I’ll see you tomorrow? Thankfully you don’t have anymore mutual classes together for the rest of the day.
                    <br><br> 
                    Madison “We have to meet up tonight, there’s that joint project that Mr set earlier that we need to make a start on”
                    <br><br> 
                    You “That’s not due for another 3 weeks, right? We have plenty of time. It’s Thursday, we can make a start on it, this weekend.”
                    <br><br> 
                    Madison’s lips are pursed. You can see the hostility bubbling under the surface. As she insists on saying nothing, you say nothing, and you’re both fixed in a stalemate, until you break it “Good talk. I’ll see you tomorrow then.” 
                    <br><br> 
                    Madison is fuming at your sassy remark. 
                    <br><br> 
                    You sit down with your friends, and there’s laughter, and 
                    <br><br> 
                    Madison gets so jealous that she marches over to the table and unleashes a spew of gossip about each of those friends at the table with me, proudly and victoriously, she reveals things that I have supposedly been saying about them behind their backs.
                    <br><br> 
                    All my friends are confused and hurt, they’re demanding that I explain, or deny the allegations. Like a rabbit in the headlights, once again I’m frozen, wordless. This is the third time I’ve been selectively mute today. I look to Madison, to plead with her, to come at rectify this mess she’s made. But, she’s too far gone, heading towards the exit. But her behaviour seemed off, she was talking to herself, mumbling something into her wrist.
